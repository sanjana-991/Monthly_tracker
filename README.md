# Monthly Expense Tracker – C++ + Python Mini Project

A simple and beginner-friendly project built by a 1st-year engineering student that tracks monthly expenses using **C++**, and visualizes them through **Python charts** — all with a single click using a **batch file**!

---

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Takes monthly expenses input in C++
- Saves the data to a `.csv` file
- Uses Python (`matplotlib`) to create:
  - 📊 Bar chart
  - 🥧 Pie chart
- Everything runs together using a `.bat` file (on Windows)

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- C++ (Input & Logic)
- Python (`matplotlib`, `pandas`)
- Batch scripting (`.bat`)
- Git & GitHub
